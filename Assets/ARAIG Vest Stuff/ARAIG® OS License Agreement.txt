1.	Development License

1.1.	Development License. Conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, IFTech hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, personal, revocable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-transferable license to: (a) use a reasonable number of copies of the ARAIG® OS on computers owned or controlled by you for the purpose of developing and testing applications that are intended for use solely in connection with an IFTech Device, and IFTech Software (“Application”); and (b) modify and incorporate into your Application any sample code provided in the ARAIG® OS.

1.1.1.	This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the ARAIG® OS to make applications, content, games, demos, movies, etc, (collectively and generally referred to as “Developer Content”) that run on hardware, mobile hardware and software products (“Approved ARAIG® Products”) and which may incorporate the ARAIG® OS in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the ARAIG® OS to create derivative works of the ARAIG® OS itself (“ARAIG® OS Derivatives” as further defined below), whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third party software unless otherwise noted.

1.1.2.	ARAIG® OS Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code derived exclusively from the ARAIG® OS by you; provided, however, that ARAIG® OS Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications, content, games or demos) which may be developed using the ARAIG® OS. By way of example a mobile application or game or demo that is developed using the ARAIG® OS would not be a ARAIG® OS Derivative, nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game engine that is adapted to work with the ARAIG® OS be a ARAIG® OS Derivative. By way of example, but not limitation, a ARAIG® OS Derivative is or would be either (i) an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the ARAIG® OS to improve efficiency; or (ii) an addition of code or improvement to the ARAIG® OS that adds functionality.

1.1.3.	For the sake of clarification when you use the ARAIG® OS (including ARAIG® OS Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including your source and object code) with IFTech or any third parties; provided, however, IFTech retains all rights to the ARAIG® OS and the ARAIG® OS Derivatives that may be incorporated into your Developer Content.

1.1.4.	You, the recipient and user of the ARAIG® OS, hereby agree and accept that IFTech shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any ARAIG® OS Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such rights to such ARAIG® OS Derivatives to IFTech, subject to the following.

1.1.5.	We hereby grant to you the fully paid up, no-charge, royalty-free, world-wide, in perpetuity, non-exclusive right and license to use these ARAIG® OS Derivatives solely in conjunction with the ARAIG® OS (or any components of the ARAIG® OS) and/or Developer Content on IFTech ARAIG® Products as set forth herein.
